      “What should I write about?” Tom wondered. His life never seemed
      remarkable to him, in all honesty, but ever since Darwin mentioned this
      book, he felt a certain urgency to leave something behind. But who would
      read such a book? A book about a man who — what was it he did? — wandered
      around in the woods with his friend? It had been done before: Bill Bryson,
      A Walk in the Woods. He remembered from high school. And how many narrated
      forest treks could a reader really stomach? He swallowed his spit between
      cold breaths in time with the metered crunching of snow beneath his
      snowshoes. <i>If I wrote a book and people wanted to read it</i>, he reasoned, <i>it
      couldn’t possibly be about me. It would have to be about someone else,
      someone more interesting.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In his reflection, Tom let out a sigh that was perhaps more audible than
      he intended, and Darwin, who strode about ten meters ahead, turned to face
      his follower. Sweaty black curls peeked out from under his hat
      and stopped just above flat, piercing blue eyes. The winter air made
      clouds out of his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you doing all right, there?” he asked, feigning genuine concern with
      machinelike precision. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Panting from the ascent, Tom replied in spurts. “I was just, uh — I was
      thinking — about the book we were — we were talking about.”
    </p>
    <p>“The book?” Darwin spoke casually, pretending not to remember.</p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. “The book. You know, the trail? I’m supposed to leave
      a trail? We were talking about it all last night.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, that.” Darwin smiled: Tom had been thinking about it all morning.
      “Don’t worry about that, Tom. I was just playing around.” Darwin baited
      him. “I didn’t mean to upset you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m not upset about it, I just — I was thinking about what kind of story
      I could even tell. I don’t think I live an interesting enough life to
      write about it, you know?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Darwin looked at Tom for a moment, proud of the silent avalanche he had
      set in motion, and then away. With the eyes of a predator, he followed the
      trunk of a nearby spruce to check to source of a sparkle of birdsong. The
      sun shone a bright yellow through frosted boughs. <i>The stillness of all
      this is good for transformation, Darwin thought. The emptiness, freedom
      from distraction. Where else but here in the mountains, in the callous
      heart of winter, could a person be subjected so mercilessly to their own
      demons? Where else could a person be forced to evolve?</i> He stopped himself,
      conscious of the temptation to bend to mystique, but reveled in what he
      saw as a successful experiment. He returned his gaze to Tom, drawn to this
      moment of vulnerability like a vulture.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You don’t think you’re interesting?” he asked. “What makes you say that?
      You’re out here with me, aren’t you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, yes, but it’s been done,” Tom insisted. “This trail, these
      mountains. It’s not like I’m climbing Everest, Dar’. It’s small stuff
      compared to, you know, all the other crazy things people out there do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s not small stuff to you, though, is it? It’s more than you’ve ever
      done.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom took the comment at face-value, ignoring the implication. “Well, yes,
      but that’s not the point.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s the point, Tom?” Darwin sharpened his tone, letting out a shadow
      of a smile. “Why are you not worth writing about?”
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Not worth writing about.</i> Tom felt a floor fall away in the pit of his
      stomach and a darkness start to creep into the sunlit forest around him.
      The moss and the snow and the glistening drops of water hanging from the
      bottoms of the laden spruce branches seemed to pale. The question stung
      him, almost as if it were designed to do so. <i>But that’s not Darwin’s
      fault</i>, thought Tom. <i>Just because I’m hurt doesn’t mean he meant to hurt
      me. I’m just sensitive. Yes, I’m just a sensitive person.</i>
    </p>
    <p>“Tom?” Darwin prodded, watching the process of dissolution.</p>
    <p>
      “Can we talk about something else? Like, can we stop talking about this
      book?” Tom was exasperated. “It just makes me feel like I’m this — this
      boring, weak person with nothing to say — all because I can’t think of
      what to write a book about.” Wide-eyed, Tom gesticulated with his trekking
      poles. “Why do we all have to write books? Some people write books, some
      people don’t. Some people sing. It’s not for me, maybe. Maybe I’m just the
      guy who follows the trail. Maybe I’m just the guy who read the books that
      other people write, because, you know, they need an audience, don’t they?
      They need readers, right?” And even if I did try to write a book, it would
      be a waste of my time because I could have been out here all day enjoying
      the real trails and the real trees and the real fucking air, but no — I
      wanted to create a false image of it for people to look at instead,
      because I thought I was such a talented fucking storyteller that I could
      wrap it all up into a neat little package for some person to pick up and
      thumb through and say, <i>Hmmm, that’s such a powerful take on the White
      Mountains! I never thought of it that way.</i> Blasphemy! Fucking blasphemy.”
      He swung at a nearby tree with his pole, connected, and was startled by
      the loud <i>crack</i>. “So rather than fuck up the rest of this hike dreaming of
      the most boring and pointless book anyone has ever read, I think I’ll just
      keep hiking through the real world and stay out of my head. And who gives
      a fuck if I’m 'the tree that falls in forest'? I fell! It’s my business! Who
      needs to know?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Darwin took off his hat, brushed it against his knee to get the snow off
      it, and put it back on. It was exhausting to be with Tom sometimes. It
      really was. The negativity welled from a source so deep Darwin thought it
      might never actually heal. The raw agitation with which he deliberated
      about his own worth, his own soul, disturbed and intrigued Darwin like the
      burning of a car wreck. <i>So much smoke for such a small fire, too</i>, he
      thought. But through the smoke Darwin saw the twisted steel frame of Tom’s
      spirit, the raw materials, the scrap. <i>If I could just burn him to the
      point where the metal is hot enough to bend, then I could create something
      truly beautiful.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Darwin stepped down the steep blanket of snow with calculating mastery,
      the teeth of his snowshoes biting into it hungrily. He met Tom’s reddened
      eyes, which still smoldered with anger and self-hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The book was just an idea, Tom,” Darwin spoke with a precise gentleness.
      “There’s more to life than — ”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s not about the book, you asshole,” Thomas snapped. “It’s about me,
      what I am. I feel like you want me to be something I’m not, but I just
      can’t be. I’m this person. I’m <i>this</i> way.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t want to change you, Tom,” Darwin lied. “I’m your friend, we’re
      just out here on the trail hiking. We’re having a good time. We don’t have
      to set any records, and you don’t have to write a book. It sounds like the
      conversation we had last night left you feeling out of sorts, and that’s
      OK.” He put a gloved hand on Tom’s shoulder. “It’s OK to feel like this.”
    </p>
    <p>“What are you, some kind of therapist? Get your hand off me!”</p>
    <p><i>Too obvious</i>, thought Darwin. <i>Subtle, subtle. Apologize.</i></p>
    <p>
      “I’m sorry,” <i>Offer nothing more than that. Simple. Keep it open-ended. His
      mind will fill in the blanks.</i> “I’m sorry, Tom.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom took in heavy breaths and exhaled great clouds of steam. Darwin’s eyes
      appeared like glass, his eyebrows relaxed, his face like a plastic mask.
      There was no comfort in those features, those alien features. Emotion
      beaded and flowed off of Darwin’s soul like rain on a tarp, never passing
      through, never sinking in. He was like a one-way mirror, impervious and
      omniscient.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s fine, Darwin.” Tom said, his gaze fixed on a nearby spruce. He could
      not look into Darwin’s glass eyes. “Let’s just — let’s just keep going.
      I’ll feel better. Let’s just keep going.” He added a lie. “I probably just
      need some food.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Darwin nodded. “Right, food. Probably just hangry.” A reassuring smile
      slackened as he turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dry, metered crunching of Tom and Darwin’s snowshoes resumed,
      relieving the singular dead silence of winter; but a darkness lingered
      around Tom like a cloud. For the first time since starting this journey,
      Tom felt afraid. He felt afraid and unquestionably alone.
