  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  
  <p>

    The self is a singular event, each unreplicated in history and probably never to be repeated in exactly the same way. A person's time here is brief, absurd, poignant, and sublime. A human life is simultaneously beautiful in its simple pleasures and
    horrifying in its inevitable disintegration. The work of daily existence is to create a coherent meaning for onself so that, at the end, one can look back on all of it and claim it proudly as one's own.

  </p>

  <p>At the same time, I consider the self (that is, the experience of it) to be a useful illusion that primarily functions to construct a model of the world to propagate the species. The human body is engineered to replicate its genes, and the brain (as a part of the body and the root of consciousness), must participate in this game.</p>

  <p>Given that consciousness is a product of a material reality, one must  question it when it attempts to transcend itself and become truth. After all, the data available to an organism are limited to a fraction of all of the signals circulating
    in the universe, and the small window through which it views the natural world is bent by innumerable irrational biases to form a world totally unlike reality. Yet, this arguably false world is the only world the organism will ever have, so one cannot sit
    anxiously weighing possibilities. One must live despite not knowing anything with certainty and simply see what happens next. Thus this philosophy, like any good philosophy, serves to end itself.</p>
