  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>

    This page serves as an autobiographical summary for those who don't know me or those who wish to know more about me. It's meant as an informal public introduction, so please treat any lack of personal detail as an invitation to reach out to me
    personally and learn more. Moreover, it's mostly about my world-view and not about my world-<i>do</i>.

  </p>

  <p>

    I consider myself to be a singular event, unreplicated in history and probably never to be repeated in exactly the same way. My time here is brief, absurd, poignant, and sublime. My life is simultaneously beautiful in its simple pleasures and
    horrifying in its inevitable disintegration. The work of my daily existence is to create a coherent meaning for myself so that, at the end, I can look back on all of it and claim it proudly as my own.

  </p>

  <p>At the same time, I consider myself (that is, the self and my experience of it) to be a useful illusion that primarily functions to construct a model of the world to propagate my species. My body is engineered to replicate its genes, and my
    brain (as a part of my body and the root of my consciousness), must participate in this game.</p>

  <p>Given that my consciousness is a product of a material reality, I have to question it when it attempts to trascend itself and become truth. After all, the data available to my organism are limited to a fraction of all of the signals circulating
    in the universe, and the small window through which I view the natural world is bent by innumerable irrational biases to form a world totally unlike reality. Yet, this arguably false world is the only world I will ever have, so I cannot sit
    anxiously weighing possibilities. I must live despite not knowing anything with certainty and simply see what happens next. Thus my philosophy, like any good philosophy, serves to end itself.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>

  <p>
    The primary transformation of my outlook on life occurred when I decided to become an atheist and abandon the religious scaffolding of my family and upbringing. Originally I was raised in a nondenominational Christian community and educated in a
    similarly religious school (note: <i>not</i> a Catholic school with ruler-weilding nuns). I, like countless people who grew up in religious contexts, started to question the authority of the Biblical canon in college. Exploring the non-canonical
    scriptures (apocrypha) and studying challenging ideas in religious philosophy (like <a href="https://www3.dbu.edu/mitchell/theodicy_brief_overview.htm" target="_blank">theodicy</a>, the justification of belief in God while there is so much evil
    in the world) dissolved my conviction that the Bible had a special claim to spiritual truth. I also met people who brought unmistakable value to my life but held contradictory religious beliefs, and I found myself unable to pass judgment on them
    for simply having followed a different path to the same point in time and space. It seemed petty to divide people into in-groups and out-groups based on the details of their theories of spiritual realities. Ultimately, it was the arbitrariness of
    my life path that dealt the fatal blow to my religious belief; supposing I had been born in another time and another place, in another family and another community, with circumstances diametrically opposed to my current ones, could I be held
    reponsible for my own religion? My answer at the time was no.
  </p>

  <p>
    Following these changes, I found myself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrownness"><i>thrown into the world</i></a> without answers to any of life's important questions. For a while, I could not say for sure whether my life had meaning,
    whether there was any continuation of experience after death, or whether there was any reason underpinning moral decisions. This was <strike>uncomfortable</strike> terrifying for me because I had lived much of my young adult life up to that point
    in relative existential security, and ever since the religious scaffolding of my worldview fell away I have been rebuilding it with what seemed like more credible material. It is, however, still a work in progress, and I feel I must always say
    that, lest I start to think I have found the one true way.
