<p>"Do you know any ghost stories?" Tom shuddered from within a cocoon of blankets.</p>
<p><span>"Ghost stories, </span><span style="font-style:italic">hm</span>." Darwin rested one arm on his knee as he sat by the roaring fire. "No, I don't care much for fiction. And I thought you were already scared. Why push the envelope?" He chuckled but Tom did not.</p>
<p>"Well," Tom sighed, "Yeah, I'm a little nervous. It's just—It's quiet out here, you know? I wanted to get my mind off things."</p>
<p>Tom's simple honesty was disarming to Darwin, but he put the wall back up. "Why don't you tell a story, then?" said Darwin. "Doesn't have to be a ghost story. Anything."</p>
<p><span>Tom gazed into the dancing orange behemoth Darwin had built for them. He thought back to the building of it, during which he felt himself to be relatively useless: ignorant of where to find birch bark, ignorant of what deadfall was or where to get it, fumbling with the handsaw. </span>I never know any stories<span>, he thought. </span>But I should try to think of one. He'll probably laugh, but I should at least try.</p>
<p>"Anything," Tom stalled, looking up at Darwin from his blanket hood.</p>
<p><span>"Yeah, Tom, anything." Darwin liked his position. He felt immense power, like he was guiding a blind man. </span>He might not like it, <span>thought Darwin, </span>but he'll do whatever I tell him to do. That's just the way he is.</p>
<p><span>Tom thought long and hard about the best story to tell. </span><span style="font-style:italic">Darwin had such an interesting life—why couldn't he just tell a story?</span><span>&nbsp;He thought about his high school days—no, too far back, too embarrassing. He thought about the people he interviewed for the Star. They were at least interesting. The man who walked across America with his dog? The woman who had cancer? </span><span style="font-style:italic">Tons of people have cancer. Why would that be interesting? </span>Suddenly, he had an idea, hesitated, and then spoke.</p>
<p>"One time I thought someone was breaking into my house," he started, nervously. "I was in my bed and I heard all these noises coming from outside, and then what I thought was a rattling door knob."</p>
<p><span>Darwin had locked eyes on his storyteller. </span><span style="font-style:italic">It's already interesting</span><span>, Darwin admitted to himself. </span><span style="font-style:italic">I thought he would just make up some excuse not to play. </span>"Go on," he said.</p>
<p>"But then I heard other sounds, too, like a man speaking Portuguese and another man talking back. They sounded—they sounded angry. I couldn't understand what they were saying."</p>
<p>"Because they were speaking Portuguese?"</p>
<p>"No, it was muffled, I—I couldn't hear them that well."</p>
<p>"But you could tell it was Portuguese?"</p>
<p>Tom paused with a concerned look. This didn't make sense to him either.</p>
<p>"Just keep going," pushed Darwin. "It's good. It's good." Darwin leaned closer to the fire to warm his hands.</p>
<p>"Anyway, I heard all these noises and the men talking and the rattling of the door knob, and I thought, shit, this is it: this is the day when it happens. This is the day when they take me. And I'm just shaking in my bed. The rattling gets louder and then I hear this—I hear this cat, this screaming cat, like the loudest, creepiest cat you've ever heard, and the two men laugh, and I think, shit, they brought a rabid cat, or a weasel or something, and it's gonna be like in the Big Lebowski—you know that scene in the Big Lebowski?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know the scene." Darwin was enjoying this.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm just scared to death that these guys are gonna come in and, you know—and I'm shaking in my bed, waiting for them to just bust through the door and—and—" He suddenly stopped, apparently confused, and blinked, staring into the fire.</p>
<p>"And what?" Darwin pressed him. His wide eyes glowed orange in the light of the fire.</p>
<p>"I'm—I'm trying to remember," said Tom. He was lying. He didn't want to remember. But he wanted to be interesting. "There were some, uh, gunshots." He swallowed.</p>
<p>"Gunshots?"</p>
<p>"Gunshots."</p>
<p>"From outside."</p>
<p>Tom had the look of a man staring into death. "Yes," he stuttered. "From outside."</p>
<p>"How many?"</p>
<p>"Th—three? Four. There were four shots."</p>
<p>Darwin sat speechless.</p>
<p>"And screaming. I heard one of the men screaming. It was horrible—the sound. I think he shot him but didn't kill him and then left him there. The guy—the guy who got shot—he's crying for help, for God to help him." He trailed off, wiped his tears with a corner of blanket. "He was out there a long time. Then the police came and I think they took him away. I think he was dead by then. Yeah, I—I think he was dead by then."</p>
<p>The campfire had burned to a glowing pile of embers between the two men, warm but silent. Tom sat gently rocking in his blanket cocoon across from Darwin, who still leaned toward the fire. He felt a tear on his right eye but looked off into the forest as he wiped it away with the sleeve of his jacket. The air around them was dark and silent; there were no birds and there was no moon.</p>
<p>"I'm—I'm going to go to sleep now, Dar'." Tom got up, holding his blankets around him. "I'll see you tomorrow." He took his headlamp and stumbled over to his small, green tent, which made the sound of a large mosquito as it unzipped and zipped back up again. Darwin remained motionless by the fire, blank-faced and gaunt in the evanescent light of the embers, like a statue that had no memory of why it was made.</p>
