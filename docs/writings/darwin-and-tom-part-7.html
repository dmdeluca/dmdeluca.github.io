          A tinkling chime announced Darwin's entrance to the gas station
          convenience store. No clerk appeared behind the plexiglass-shielded
          checkout counter, but Darwin saw the globular eye of a security camera
          fixed to the ceiling above him, a black mirror to the small,
          encapsulated world of buying and selling the most-wanted and
          most-often-forgotten consumable goods. <i>How embarrassing</i>, he
          thought. <i>Someone's job is to watch this farce.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Tom followed swiftly through the door behind Darwin with no official
          introduction from the door chime, which had already been triggered. He
          wandered around the fronts of several aisles before choosing one
          conspicuously populated with snacks and stopping midway. He turned to
          a rack of assorted pretzels and said quietly to himself, "Oh, wow,
          they really have everything."
        </p>
        <p>
          Darwin, still close enough to hear him, rolled his eyes in contempt.
          <i>Of course they have everything, </i>he thought<i
            >. That's the whole point of a convenience store.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Darwin hated shopping at convenience stores. Finding oneself at a
          convenience store, he believed, was contingent on unexpected need.
          Unexpected need could only result from a lack of preparation. To
          neglect to anticipate an need was a choice, a failure to foresee the
          array of possible scenarios, a product of poor mental discipline,
          inadequate checks. Up to this moment he had every opportunity to check
          and check again that he had brought his food with him, but he chose
          otherwise, and he alone was responsible. Now he was a have-not at the
          mercy of the haves, without any recourse but to pay for his
          necessities with a sizeable convenience fee.
        </p>
        <p>
          He took the shortest path to a snack aisle abutting Tom's and scanned
          the shelves for a substantive replacement to his carefully designed
          meal bag. Jerky was his first choice, but he resented the paltry
          portion sizes, especially when he thought of what he could make—did
          make—at home with his own agency. "God dammit,"" he muttered to
          himself, and took five of the largest bags off the shelf. "So much
          plastic, so much fucking plastic. I'm the reason we have landf—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "What are you getting?" Tom materialized next to him, one arm
          clutching several bags of chocolate-covered pretzels close to his
          chest. <i>He's in his element</i>, thought Darwin.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Jerky," said Darwin. "It's good protein." He looked down at what Tom
          carried. "Those pretzels will sustain you for about half an hour, and
          then you'll crash. Let's be serious, Tom. I don't want to have to drag
          you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Tom eyed his collection, a childlike smile evaporating from his lips.
          "I got some meat, too, you asshole," he protested, making his way to
          the next aisle over, where he sulked while pretending to look for more
          to buy. "Asshole," Darwin heard him mutter again under his breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>He's sensitive today, </i>thought Darwin.
          <i>He's always sensitive, I suppose. And we haven't even started his
            work yet. This should get—interesting. </i>He smirked, holding his bags of jerky and scanning the rest of the
          aisle, comparing the items he saw to the mental inventory he kept of
          his backpack. He had everything else he needed, he thought, but that's
          exactly what he had been thinking when he left his food bag behind.
          Even that sense of security was suspect now. Anxiety began to pool around the corners of his mind. <i>It would be worthwhile to
          check now</i>, he deliberated, <i>if it means being prepared later. It would be smart.</i> He
          sighed, put the bags of jerky back on the shelf, and strode out of the
          gas station, a tinkling bell marking his departure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tom's head poked up from behind a stack of tomato soup cans. "Dar'?"
          he said sheepishly, barely audible to himself. And louder, "Hey,
          Dar'?" Tom froze like a deer, still clutching his snacks (which had
          visibly multiplied). The store was empty, silent except for a tinny
          top 40 pop song played quietly through an invisible sound system. Tom
          then heard the faint chirp of the Camry unlocking outside, followed by
          the opening and slamming of a door. In a sudden panic, he rushed to
          the glass windows at the front of the store to look out.
        </p>
        <p>"You have to pay for those," intoned the cashier.</p>
        <p>
          "Oh, uh, yeah, OK," Tom mumbled, distracted, before dumping his items
          in front of the cashier and darting out the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pacing hurriedly toward the car, Tom called out to Darwin, seeing him
          loading a backpack on the ground, his breath making great clouds of
          stream. "I'll just be a few more minutes, Dar', I swear. Don't leave
          without me, please."
        </p>
        <p>
          Darwin looked up from the pile of miscellaneous items he had emptied
          onto the pavement. It took effort to break the trancelike
          concentration with which he counted and recounted, arranged and
          rearranged, rehearsing his memorized list of essential winter hiking
          equipment. He had no idea what Tom was talking about.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What?" asked Darwin, his face still marked by intense attention to
          his task.
        </p>
        <p>"I'm almost done. Don't leave."</p>
        <p>
          "Leave?" Darwin repeated, realizing how Tom had misinterpreted events.
          "Why would I leave?" He explained what he was doing. "Preparedness,
          Tom. Remember?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh," said Tom, looking down at his feet. "I—OK." He turned to go
          back into the convenience store. The chime from his entry was faint
          from the parking spot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Darwin knelt in silence, noting the bizarreness of Tom's behavior.
          <i
            >He really thought I was just going to pack up and leave without
            him? Is he really that insecure? </i
          >A fragile bubble of pity rose up in Darwin's chest. He felt sorry for
          him.
          <i
            >What happened to this guy? He's never talked about any of this.
            Poor—</i
          >but he stopped himself, pierced the bubble of pity, and shook his
          head.
          <i
            >Tom is not ready for any of this. Physically unprepared.
            Emotionally unstable. Fragile. He's a puppy. He's a fucking puppy.
            Therapy, that's what he needs. Therapy. </i
          >And he began shoving his equipment back into the main compartment of
          his pack with far more force than was required. When he was finished, he loaded his pack back into the backseat of the car. He hadn't forgotten anything else. Once he had that jerky, he would be
          perfectly prepared.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Darwin reentered the store, he saw Tom standing at the checkout
          counter making small talk about something Darwin couldn't make out and
          didn't care to ascertain. Tom glanced briefly in Darwin's direction,
          met his eyes, but then shot his gaze sharply downward. Their voices
          faded from Darwin's attention as he returned to retrieve his bags of
          jerky, now resigned to the purchase as to a necessary evil. Now the
          task was to carry it out as quickly and efficiently as possible. He
          approached the checkout counter, bags in hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tom and the cashier were still talking. Tom had a nervous laugh that
          crept out among strangers. He made three short voiced exhalations in
          rapid succession, each slightly higher in pitch than the one that came
          before it. It could have been a recording triggered by a button in
          Tom's sleeve. Darwin found this laugh annoying, but he couldn't
          formulate a coherent reason as to why.
          <i>It must be inherited from the source</i>, he thought.
          <i
            >Anything that comes out of this man's mouth seems fraught with
            falseness and triviality. A worldly man. A plastic man with his
            plastic bags.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          "I can help who's next." The expectant voice summoned Darwin from his
          inner world. He took three paces forward and placed his plastic bags
          of jerky on the counter with a robotic delicateness, as if to
          demonstrate his perfect control over material objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Will that be all," the clerk said dryly, apparently not sociable in
          the general case.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes," said Darwin. He looked the cashier straight in the eye,
          deliberately suppressing the socialized habit of smiling. The cashier
          noted the total amount, and Darwin slid his debit card into the chip
          reader. As the funds left his account, he envisioned the mark of the
          beast emblazoned&nbsp; on his forehead—the mark of the eternal
          consumer, rapacious and mindless, bound with tubes pumping sludge in
          and out of every orifice. He shuddered.
          <i>The price we pay for poor planning,</i> he thought,
          <i
            >is more than this; it's this humiliating dependency on a system
            that despises me, sees me as a walking wallet, as less than human.
            Participating, I, too, despise myself.</i
          >&nbsp;A voice interrupted his moment of clarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do you want a receipt," said the cashier, flattening the question
          into a statement, the answer to which did not concern him in the
          slightest.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, thanks." Darwin was eager to escape this colorful plastic
          hellhole. A receipt was just a litany of his transgressions. He took
          the small plastic bag that read, "Have a nice day" on its crinkling
          skin and scoffed to himself. <i>Cog in the machine.</i>
        </p>
        <p>"Do you want a bag." The sheer lifelessness of the cashier's voice scraped Darwin's ears like a needle.</p>
        <p>"No. Thanks." Each word was a separate statement. <i>Get me out of here.</i></p>
        <p>"Are you sure? It's a lot of jerky, dude."</p>
        <p>
          No reply from Darwin. He took his card
          and jerky in a hurried gesture and strode out of the
          store. He welcomed the chime as a ceremonial end to a ridiculous
          charade.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the car, Darwin saw Tom already sitting in the passenger seat. He
          got in the driver's side after placing his purchases on the floor of
          the seat behind him, and started the engine.
        </p>
        <p>"Thanks for waiting," said Tom, crunching a pretzel.</p>
        <p>
          "Sure, Tom." Darwin responded as a reflex. He forgot what he had
          waited for but didn't ask.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dry, hardened snow made a muffled crunching sound as Darwin
          reversed out of the parking spot, and the engine growled hungrily
          across the road to the onramp to I-93.
